## 🎬 What is NETLIFE?

NETLIFE is a **local-first AI application** that transforms the raw, chaotic, beautiful mess of your real life into a complete Netflix show concept — in under 60 seconds.

No cloud. No API keys. No subscription. No data leaving your device. Just you, a local language model, and the dramatic series your life always deserved.

## ✨ What Gets Generated

Feed it your name, your job, your city, your biggest quirk, and one dramatic moment. What comes back is a **complete cinematic press kit**:

| Section | What You Get |
|---|---|
| 🎭 **Show Identity** | Title, tagline, genre, Netflix rating, content warnings |
| 📖 **The Logline** | A two-sentence hook that sells your entire life |
| 👤 **Protagonist Bio** | Your fictional alter-ego — age, fatal flaw, dark secret |
| 🎬 **Supporting Cast** | 3 fully fleshed characters with roles and descriptions |
| 🌀 **Season 1 Arc** | Complete 3-act breakdown — Setup, Confrontation, Resolution |
| 📋 **Episode Guide** | 8 episodes with dramatic titles and descriptions |
| 🎥 **Trailer Script** | A ready-to-share voiceover script for your official trailer |
| 💾 **My Shows Gallery** | Every show you've ever generated, saved and viewable forever |

---

## 🖥️ The UI Experience

This isn't a form with a text dump. Every screen is designed to feel like you're inside Netflix:

**Landing Page** — Floating show posters rising in the background. Mouse-tracking spotlight. Live trending ticker. Genre cycling animation. A featured "Untitled Series — Starring: You" card.

**Input Form** — Slides up from the bottom like a native app sheet. Live completion ring. Field-by-field focus animations. Dramatic casting room aesthetic.

**Loading Screen** — A full cinematic clapperboard with your name in the DIRECTOR slot. Live 24fps timecode. REC indicator. Production stage checklist. Animated progress glow.

**Show Card** — A scrollable Netflix press kit. Protagonist card with spinning avatar ring. Three-column season arc. Episode guide with hover reveals. Screenplay-format trailer script with one-click copy.

## 🎭 Sample Output

> *Input: AI Engineer, Chennai, debugs at 3am, quit job for AI startup*
```
SHOW TITLE    →  "MIDNIGHT VISIONARY"
TAGLINE       →  "Where the line between man and machine blurs."
GENRE         →  Drama, Sci-Fi, Tech Thriller
RATING        →  TV-MA
CONTENT       →  Strong language, Thematic elements, Intense work stress

EPISODE 01    →  "3am Revelations"

EPISODE 03    →  "Rivalry Unleashed"
...
EPISODE 08    →  "A Future Unveiled"

TRAILER       →  "Deep in the heart of Chennai, one engineer works
                  tirelessly — building the future with AI. But as he
                  pushes technology to its limits, he risks losing
                  everything that matters..."
```

## 🛠️ How the AI Prompt Works

The core of NETLIFE is a carefully engineered structured prompt that forces Mistral to output strict JSON — no markdown, no explanation, no hallucinated fields:
```
You are a creative Netflix show writer.
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object.
No backticks. No preamble. Raw JSON only.

{
  "show_title": "...",
  "tagline": "...",
  "genre": "...",
  ...
}
```

Combined with Ollama's `format: "json"` parameter, this achieves near-perfect structured output from a 7B model running entirely on consumer hardware.
